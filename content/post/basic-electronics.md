## Getting started with understanding of basic Concepts and Components of Electronics

#### (NO DEFINITIONS ,ONLY UNDERSTANDING)

### Concepts

#### What is Electricity ?

We all have heard term, Electricity.

But when we need to explain this term, we can see the working fan, glowing tube and yes, after plugging in phone's charger, simply we can see the increasing percentage sign.

Have you ever tried to explore, what is this Electricity ?
What does this contain due to which phone's battery is charging and i am able to use it in daily life and yes, what is this term charging means ?

So for this, we need to know about the term "Charge".

In this article, I am covering about the basic and important terms which a person should know befor getting started with electronics projects.

#### Charge :

We all at one point must have observered a very common phenomena of rubbing a silk cloth with glass rod or when you comb your hair or take off your hat on a cold, dry day, your hair stand on the end.

So what is the reason behind this ?

Let's take example of silk cloth and glass rod. Take two pair of glass and silk cloth. When you rub each glass rod with its respective cloth, you will observer that after rubbing, one glass rod will repel another glass rod and same is the case with silk cloth i.e. one silk cloth will repel another silk cloth.

But glass rods will start attracting their respective silk clothes.

When this phenomena was observed, in old times, it was said that there were inivisible "fluids" which were flowing from one object to another and were able to effect a physical force over a distance.

Later, Charles Dufay was one of the early experimenters who demonstrated that there were definitely two different types of changes wrought by rubbing certain pairs of objects together. The fact that there was more than one type of change manifested in these materials was evident by the fact that there were two types of forces produced: attraction and repulsion. The hypothetical fluid transfer became known as a "Charge".

Later,one researcher, Benjamin Franklin,came to the conclusion that the two types of invisible fluids were not actually two, it was only one type of fluid that is tranferred when two materials are rubbed together, and that the two different “charges” were nothing more than either an excess or a deficiency of that one fluid.After experimenting with wax and wool(like we are taking case of glass rod and silk cloth), he observed that wool removed some of invisible fluid from wax, which created deficiency of fluid in wax and attraction force is because wax wanted to regain its fluid and trying to achieve its neutral state.

So following Franklin’s speculation of the wool rubbing something off of the wax, the type of charge that was associated with rubbed wax became known as “negative” (because it was supposed to have a deficiency of fluid) while the type of charge associated with the rubbing wool became known as “positive” (because it was supposed to have an excess of fluid).

As further experiments proceeded and the concept of atom came into light, it was discovered much later that this “fluid” was actually composed of extremely small bits of matter called "Electrons".

You must be wondering about the term "Electrons".Let's have a very small overview of that as well.

Till now,that all objects are composed of extremely small “building-blocks” known as atoms and that these atoms are in turn composed of smaller components known as particles. The three fundamental particles comprising most atoms are called protons, neutrons and electrons. Atoms are far too small to be seen, but if we could look at one, it might appear something like this:

// image of atom

In this image, the structure of atom can be observed. Here protons and neutrons are tightly coupled with each other forming nucleus, but electrons are loosely coupled due to a lot of empty space between nucleus and electrons.

Note: protons give the unique identity to atom.If we can remove proton from atom, we can change one element to another.

As electrons have significantly more freedom to move around in an atom than either protons or neutrons. In fact, they can be knocked out of their respective positions (even leaving the atom entirely!) by far less energy than what it takes to dislodge particles in the nucleus. If this happens, the atom still retains its chemical identity, but an important imbalance occurs. Electrons and protons are unique in the fact that they are attracted to one another over a distance. It is this attraction over distance which causes the attraction between rubbed objects, where electrons are moved away from their original atoms to reside around atoms of another object.

Electrons tend to repel other electrons over a distance, as do protons with other protons. The only reason protons bind together in the nucleus of an atom is because of a much stronger force called the strong nuclear force which has effect only under very short distances. Because of this attraction/repulsion behavior between individual particles, electrons and protons are said to have opposite electric charges. That is, each electron has a negative charge, and each proton a positive charge. In equal numbers within an atom, they counteract each other’s presence so that the net charge within the atom is zero. This is why the picture of a carbon atom has six electrons: to balance out the electric charge of the six protons in the nucleus. If electrons leave or extra electrons arrive, the atom’s net electric charge will be imbalanced, leaving the atom “charged” as a whole, causing it to interact with charged particles and other charged atoms nearby. Neutrons are neither attracted to or repelled by electrons, protons, or even other neutrons and are consequently categorized as having no charge at all.

The process of electrons arriving or leaving is exactly what happens when certain combinations of materials are rubbed together: electrons from the atoms of one material are forced by the rubbing to leave their respective atoms and transfer over to the atoms of the other material. In other words, electrons comprise the “fluid” hypothesized by Benjamin Franklin.
