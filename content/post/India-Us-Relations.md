A hotline is a point-to-point communications link in which a call is automatically directed to the preselected destination without any additional action by the user when the end instrument goes off-hook. An example would be a phone that automatically connects to emergency services on picking up the receiver.

3 military excercises performed with US now a days -

1. Vajra Prahar
2. Yudh Abhyas
3. Shatrujeet 2006

But it was not the same in history. Let us have a look on history first:
It was the time when two countries got independence in 1947 i.e. India and Pakistan.On 20th October,1947 i.e after two months and six days after Pakistan's Independence, US established relations with Pakistan and It was the first nation who established the relation with new state.There were 3 reasons of this relation :

1. Dominance in middle east,gulf nation and South Asia.
2. Countering U.S.S.R

India was having non-alignment policy at that time according to which India will not act in favour of any nation.The reason of such policy was the time of cold war.India didn't want to involve in cold war and wanted to be neutral.But to counter US-PAK relation, India started building strong strategic,economic and military relations with Russia.

For next 14 years, India was having cold war with US till the time John F kennedy became president of US.
At the time of John F kennedy, started building relations with India to counterweight the rise of communist China after Vietnam and Korean war where US face challenge from China.

This relation with US was quite helpful at the time of Indo-China war in 1962 where US helped India by sending USS kitty Hawk aircraft.

But US turned the table in Indo-Pak war in 1965 where it helped Pakistan by sending F-104 and F-86 fighter aircrafts which were super fast aircrafts at that time.Befor this India asked for these aircrafts but US refused to give those to India but helped Pakistan with those aircrafts.
In 1971 also, US helped Pakistan in bangladesh liberation war with USS Enterprise Aircraft carrier in Bay of Bengal but due to cease fire, US had to take back the aircraft.
After this all, in intrest of itself, India took some actions one of which was Smiling Buddha.India practiced a nuclear test which got failed but US opposed this test of India.
