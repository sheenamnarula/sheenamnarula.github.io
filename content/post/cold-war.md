The cold war was a state of geopolitical tension after second world war between Eastern Bloc(The Soviet Union and its satellite states) and Western Bloc(the United States and its NATO Alies)

THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION (NATO)
The Cold War was in full swing, as the Soviet Union was rising to power, capturing satellite countries. Using their strong dynamic forces, the Soviet Union captured surrounding countries first to help protect them from any invasion. This tactic was used to imprison civilians and force them to join the Soviet military. As their armed forces greatly increased in numbers, other countries and nations feared that the Soviet Union would expand their control and take over other countries.

In response to this, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed. NATO is a formal alliance between the territories of North American and Europe. From its inception, its main purpose was to defend each other from the possibility of communist Soviet Union taking control of their nation. Many powerful countries joined NATO by the signing of the official document in 1949: Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, Iceland, Luxembourg, United States, Canada, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Portugal. In 1950, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated and appointed as the first supreme allied commander. Since Eisenhower was from the United States, this allowed the U.S. to be a strong force in the organization. West Germany, Turkey and Greece joined by 1955.

Today, NATO is ideally an outstanding way for the twenty-six different countries and nations to come together. As an organization, the leaders meet with one another to make decisions about security issues and defensive issues against allied attacks. Also, NATO has armed forces, made up of civilians of all twenty-six countries. They defend and aid countries in crisis, just like Darfur. The North Atlantic Council is made up on knowledgeable political and military leaders represented by each country. This council comes to a consensus on making important decisions on what political and military tactics to use, for daily activity.

Cold war era - 1947 to 1989/1991.
But actually it doesnot have any fix date.

Why it is called cold war - No direct combat or fight between USSR + Allies and US + allies but there were proxy wars like Korean War,Vietnam War and Afghanistan war.

Proxy wars are like if there are two super powers A(US) and B(Soviet Union), and war is going on between C and D, then A is supporting C and B is supporting D. In this way, they are showing their power to each other indirectly.

### Characteristics of Cold war -

1.  Ideological differences(US is Capitalist and Soviet is Communist)
2.  Atmosphere of political distrust(Each power was thinking that other power wanted to invade in its region)
3.  Brinkmanship(means taking world to the edge of war and then take a step back)
4.  Psycological warfare(both powers thought that the other power is evil and there was a need to be ready to handle any war)
5.  Arms Race- High military spending
6.  Espionage(always keeping an eye on other power's secrets and sending detectived to reveal those)

#### Nuclear Capability

Both powers could destroy earth many times over because of their nuclear capabilities.This was the main reason due to which cold warn never turned out to be a hot war.

### The Beginnings of Cold war -

Many people says that the cold war was started with the Russian Revolution in which there was a civil war between Reds(Communists) and Whites.Reds won the war and USSR was established in 1922.USA,UK and France supported Whites at that time.So there were obvious frictions between communists and these nations.US didn't give the recognition to USSR initially but 1933 Diplomatic Relations between USSR and US got established.

##### Reason behind Non-Recoginition :

On December 6, 1917, the U.S. Government broke off diplomatic relations with Russia, shortly after the Bolshevik Party seized power from the Tsarist regime after the “October Revolution.” President Woodrow Wilson decided to withhold recognition at that time because the new Bolshevik government had refused to honor prior debts to the United States incurred by the Tsarist government, ignored pre-existing treaty agreements with other nations, and seized American property in Russia following the October Revolution. The Bolsheviks had also concluded a separate peace with Germany at Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, ending Russian involvement in World War I. Despite extensive commercial links between the United States and the Soviet Union throughout the 1920s, Wilson’s successors upheld his policy of not recognizing the Soviet Union.

After world war II in 1945,USSR tried to influence throughout central and eastern Europe as a buffer against Germany because in WWI and WWII, Germany attacked Russia and USSR totally understood that in future this could happen again. So to avoid this situation, it thought to create buffer which can be done through eastern and central Europe.
On the other side, USA was trying to influence France,West Germany,Japan and Korea and tried to set up Capitalism supporting leaders in these countries.
So in this type of atmosphere, Wintson Churchill,the Prime Minister of England, gave a statement "An Iron Curtain has descended over the continent".Iron curtain terms refer to the following picture of map :

#####The Iron Curtain
It was the name for the non-physical boundary dividing Europe into two separate areas from the end of World War II in 1945 until the end of the Cold War in 1991. The term symbolizes the efforts by the Soviet Union to block itself and its satellite states from open contact with the West and its allied states. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union, while on the west side were the countries that were allied to the United States or nominally neutral. Separate international economic and military alliances were developed on each side of the Iron Curtain.
(West Germany was captured by America,France and Britain and East Germany was occupied by Soviet Union)

Against this Iron Curtain, America opted for some policies to stop further expansion of Communism in Europe.These policies were :

1.  Containment Policy
