The cold war was a state of geopolitical tension after second world war between Eastern Bloc(The Soviet Union and its satellite states) and Western Bloc(the United States and its NATO Alies)

Cold war era - 1947 to 1989/1991.
But actually it doesnot have any fix date.

Why it is called cold war - No direct combat or fight between USSR + Allies and US + allies but there were proxy wars like Korean War,Vietnam War and Afghanistan war.

Proxy wars are like if there are two super powers A(US) and B(Soviet Union), and war is going on between C and D, then A is supporting C and B is supporting D. In this way, they are showing their power to each other indirectly.

### Characteristics of Cold war -

1.  Ideological differences(US is Capitalist and Soviet is Communist)
2.  Atmosphere of political distrust(Each power was thinking that other power wanted to invade in its region)
3.  Brinkmanship(means taking world to the edge of war and then take a step back)
4.  Psycological warfare(both powers thought that the other power is evil and there was a need to be ready to handle any war)
5.  Arms Race- High military spending
6.  Espionage(always keeping an eye on other power's secrets and sending detectived to reveal those)

#### Nuclear Capability

Both powers could destroy earth many times over because of their nuclear capabilities.This was the main reason due to which cold warn never turned out to be a hot war.

### The Beginnings of Cold war -

Many people says that the cold war was started with the Russian Revolution in which there was a civil war between Reds(Communists) and Whites.Reds won the war and USSR was established in 1922.USA,UK and France supported Whites at that time.So there were obvious frictions between communists and these nations.US didn't give the recognition to USSR initially but 1933 Diplomatic Relations between USSR and US got established.

##### Reason behind Non-Recoginition :

On December 6, 1917, the U.S. Government broke off diplomatic relations with Russia, shortly after the Bolshevik Party seized power from the Tsarist regime after the “October Revolution.” President Woodrow Wilson decided to withhold recognition at that time because the new Bolshevik government had refused to honor prior debts to the United States incurred by the Tsarist government, ignored pre-existing treaty agreements with other nations, and seized American property in Russia following the October Revolution. The Bolsheviks had also concluded a separate peace with Germany at Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, ending Russian involvement in World War I. Despite extensive commercial links between the United States and the Soviet Union throughout the 1920s, Wilson’s successors upheld his policy of not recognizing the Soviet Union.

After world war II in 1945,USSR tried to influence throughout central and eastern Europe as a buffer against Germany because in WWI and WWII, Germany attacked Russia and USSR totally understood that in future this could happen again. So to avoid this situation, it thought to create buffer which can be done through eastern and central Europe.
On the other side, USA was trying to influence France,West Germany,Japan and Korea and tried to set up Capitalism supporting leaders in these countries.
So in this type of atmosphere, Wintson Churchill,the Prime Minister of England, gave a statement "An Iron Curtain has descended over the continent".Iron curtain terms refer to the following picture of map :

#####The Iron Curtain
It was the name for the non-physical boundary dividing Europe into two separate areas from the end of World War II in 1945 until the end of the Cold War in 1991. The term symbolizes the efforts by the Soviet Union to block itself and its satellite states from open contact with the West and its allied states. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union, while on the west side were the countries that were allied to the United States or nominally neutral. Separate international economic and military alliances were developed on each side of the Iron Curtain.
(West Germany was captured by America,France and Britain and East Germany was occupied by Soviet Union)

Against this Iron Curtain, America opted for some policies.

1.  Containment Policy: This policy is about stopping further expansion of Communism.

2.  Marshall Plan for Resconstruction: America provided economic help to the countries which suffered a lot of destruction in war. In this way, according to marshall plan, it tried to establish capitalism in those countries.

3.  Truman Doctrine,1947: According to this policy, US said that it would support every country which is against communism.It would provide economic,political and even military help to the countries which were against communism.That was why South Korea was supported by US in Korean War.

4.  US also propped up many communist regimes throughout the world.

## Incidents of Cold War:

### Berlin Blockade,1948:

At that time, West Berlin was under USA and East Berlin was under USSR. The USSR wanted to control entire Berlin.As Berlin was surrounded by USSR, so it stopped the supply route to west Berlin.But USA UK air dropped supplies to break the blockade to maintain west Berlin.For around one year, with the help of two lakh planes, they maintained west Berlin by providing food, fuel etc.So at last, USSR dropped the blockade because it was not successful as air dropped supplies were quite helpful in providing stuff to people.

In 1949, Germany was officially divided into two parts East Germany(under USSR) and West Germany(under US)

### 1949 Events:

#### THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION (NATO)

Berlin blockade happened in 1948 because of which America was quite aware that it has to do something about USSR.So USA and some other countries formed NATO.A breif description of NATO is here :

The Cold War was in full swing, as the Soviet Union was rising to power, capturing satellite countries. Using their strong dynamic forces, the Soviet Union captured surrounding countries first to help protect them from any invasion. This tactic was used to imprison civilians and force them to join the Soviet military. As their armed forces greatly increased in numbers, other countries and nations feared that the Soviet Union would expand their control and take over other countries.

In response to this, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed. NATO is a formal alliance between the territories of North American and Europe. From its inception, its main purpose was to defend each other from the possibility of communist Soviet Union taking control of their nation. Many powerful countries joined NATO by the signing of the official document in 1949: Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, Iceland, Luxembourg, United States, Canada, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Portugal. In 1950, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated and appointed as the first supreme allied commander. Since Eisenhower was from the United States, this allowed the U.S. to be a strong force in the organization. West Germany, Turkey and Greece joined by 1955.

Today, NATO is ideally an outstanding way for the twenty-six different countries and nations to come together. As an organization, the leaders meet with one another to make decisions about security issues and defensive issues against allied attacks. Also, NATO has armed forces, made up of civilians of all twenty-six countries. They defend and aid countries in crisis, just like Darfur. The North Atlantic Council is made up on knowledgeable political and military leaders represented by each country. This council comes to a consensus on making important decisions on what political and military tactics to use, for daily activity.

#### Result of civil war in CHINA

In China Civil War, Communist won and China fell under Communist power except Taiwan.

#### Nuclear Weapon by USSR

In 1949, USSR tested its first nuclear weapon. USA was already having nuclear weapon as we all know about Hiroshima and Nagasaki incident.USA always convinced countries to be with it by showing its nuclear power but now USSR was also having nuclear weapons.This was the main reason why this cold war did not turn out to be hot war.

Many communist govts were established in east and central Europe

By 1950, it was quite clear that the two sides were at war without open conflict and the basically it was an ideological war between communism and capitalism.

### Nuclear Angle

First time in human history,humans were having that power which could destroy human race and earth like 50 times.
Initially, nuclear bombs needed to be carried in planes to attack like in case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, America sent its planes carrying nuclear bombs to attack.But during this cold war,BALLISTIC MISSILES were developed which could carry nuclear bombs over thousands of killometres.ICBM(Inter Continent Ballistic Missiles) assured mutual assured destrucion which is termed as MAD, means if USA attacked USSR, then in return USSR could also attack USA and both had to suffer same losses.

### Korean war(1950-1953)

It was a first proxy war between these two nations.After world war II, North Korea was under USSR and South Korea was under USA.In 1950,there was a war between North Korea and South Korea.
USSR and PRC backed North Korea and attacked South Korea.
USA and allies came to aid south and a stalemate ensued.(stalemate means no party won and border was still the same).
After this a Cease fire agreement was signed between North and South Korea.

### Domino Theory

After Korean war, domino theory came into being.
![Example image](/img/domino-theory.jpeg)

According to this theory, communism is like a domino.If one country fell in a domino, then due to its effect other countries would also fall.Like in 1950, communism was established in China,north Vietnam,Korea,Laos and USA was afraid of that communism could also be established in Thailand, Malaysia, India, Burma etc.So USA thought to stop the domino effect, they need to start a proxy war and Vietnam war was the result of this thought.

### 1950s Escalation

In decade of 1950, cold war was at its height.
1953 - Stalin died and a new leader for USSR was Nikita Khrushchev and in USA elections, Eisenhower was chosen by public as a new President.

1955- USSR signed a WARSAW pact with communist countries agains NATO.

At this time, along with arms race, Space race also began.First satellite and first person to space was sent by Soviet Union but in moon race, America won.

In 1950s, USSR was supporting communist rebels in Latin America,Asia and Africa.

USA showed a different face to world in 1950s. Just to stop communism, it also supported dictatorship in many countries like Iran,Chile,Brazil,Dominica etc.For this support, USA's reputation got affected because USA was a champion of democracy but it supported dictatorship to stop communism.

1956- Hungarian Revolution crushed by soviets by sending military.It was the first time, USSR sent its army in other country to supress revolution.

1956- Suez crisis - There was a Suez canal which existed in Egypt but was under England because it built this canal. Egypt govt. wanted to nationalize it. So at that time, England, France and Isryl attacked on Egypt but at the mean time USSR participated and backed Egypt.USSR threatened that it could be a nuclear war.At that USA, pressurized England, France and Isryl to take back their armies from Egypt.

1950s- War in Indochina raged on
War was going on in France colonies and Communist governments supported the local people there against France government.South Vietnam was supported by America.

When there were two groups in the world, a third group also came into being which was of Non-Aligned countries whose leaders were India, Egypt, Indonesia and Yugoslavia.Non-aligned movement came into being in 1961.According to this, the countries which are part of this movement were neither supporting US nor USSR.

With this a terminology,THREE WORLD ORDER came into being. According to this First World was Capitalist Countries(Western Bloc),Second World was Communism(Eastern Bloc) and Third World included Non-aligned countries.

### 1960s

##### 1960- U2 plane incident

1960 - USA sent a plane over USSR to spy.That plane got crashed and pilot was arrested by USSR.There was a summit going to be held in Paris to find a solution of cold war.Due to this incident, USSR was annoyed and that summit got failed.

1961- Berlin wall was constructed by East Germany to stop people who were moving secretly to West Germany because they did not want to live under communist government.

1962- Cuban crisis
Cuban missile crisis, (October 1962), major confrontation that brought the United States and the Soviet Union close to war over the presence of Soviet nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba.

Having promised in May 1960 to defend Cuba with Soviet arms, the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev assumed that the United States would take no steps to prevent the installation of Soviet medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba. Such missiles could hit much of the eastern United States within a few minutes if launched from Cuba. The United States learned in July 1962 that the Soviet Union had begun missile shipments to Cuba. By August 29 new military construction and the presence of Soviet technicians had been reported by U.S. U-2 spy planes flying over the island, and on October 14 the presence of a ballistic missile on a launching site was reported.

After carefully considering the alternatives of an immediate U.S. invasion of Cuba (or air strikes of the missile sites), a blockade of the island, or further diplomatic maneuvers, Pres. John F. Kennedy decided to place a naval “quarantine,” or blockade, on Cuba to prevent further Soviet shipments of missiles. Kennedy announced the quarantine on October 22 and warned that U.S. forces would seize “offensive weapons and associated material” that Soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to Cuba. During the following days, Soviet ships bound for Cuba altered course away from the quarantined zone. As the two superpowers hovered close to the brink of nuclear war, messages were exchanged between Kennedy and Khrushchev amidst extreme tension on both sides. On October 28 Khrushchev capitulated, informing Kennedy that work on the missile sites would be halted and that the missiles already in Cuba would be returned to the Soviet Union. In return, Kennedy committed the United States never to invade Cuba. Kennedy also secretly promised to withdraw the nuclear-armed missiles that the United States had stationed in Turkey in previous years. In the following weeks both superpowers began fulfilling their promises, and the crisis was over by late November. Cuba’s communist leader, Fidel Castro, was infuriated by the Soviets’ retreat in the face of the U.S. ultimatum but was powerless to act.

1962 Sano Soviet separation
China got separated from USSR saying that ideology behind the communist government of USSR is different from the ideology it is following being a communist country.
But both continued to support gorillas in Vietnam war.

1968- Praque spring reforms crushed by USSR.

Vietnam war carried on at a brutal scale.Finally,North Vietnam won backed by USSR won in 1975.

### 1970s De-Escalation

1972- US and China established diplomatic relations, trade relations and America gave recognition to China

1973- Detente(Cooperation) between USA and USSR
Under this, SALT(Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) was successful in which two topics were discussed :
-Reducing nuclear missiles
-Reducing anti ballistic missiles

After SALT, tension between two nations was significanly reduced. But in 1979, USSR send troops to Afghanistan to help newly formed Communist govt. which annoyed USA as USA thought that USSR was following its old policy of expansion. So in return, USA supported Mujaheedin(rebels in Afghanistan) against USSR.So this again ended cooperation between USSR and USA.

### 1980s

In 1979, due to end in cooperation between USSR and USA, USA boycotted olympics held in Moscow in 1980 and USSR boycotted olympics held in Los Angeles in 1984.

1981 -
In 1981,Ronald Regan became the President of USA and he spent on military immenselt which could not be competed by USSR due to it failing economy.

USSR was shocked about USA's Strategic Defensive Initiative plan under which satellites were supposed to be equipped with nuclear missiles.This was named as STAR WARS by people.But later this plan was not finalized by USA.

1983-
Large NATO military exercise made USSR to think about USA was gonna attack USSR and brought the world on brink if nuclear annihilation.

South Korean civilian plane shot down by USSR giving excuse that this plane was sent to spy in USSR.

1985- Mikhail Gorbachev becomes Gen. Sec.of Communist party in USSR. After his arriavl, cold war started to end.

##### The end of Cold War

Main reason- reforms brought by Gorbachev and economy of USSR.

The communist economy simply could not keep up with high growth rates of capitalist ones because of non-existence of privatization of industries.To increase the economic growth, Gorbachev brougt reforms which were :

Glasnost : It included:

1. Openness
2. Freedom of speech
3. Easing of media censorship(now news from America and other parts of the world could be seen by people)
4. Earlier records declassified by RTI

Perestroika
Restructuring/Reformation was done under which Soviet Political and Economic structure was improved.

The most important part of Political reforms was Elections.Elections was not mean that there were different parties but it was selection of communist party members by people, initially which was done by higher authorities of communist party.

Foreign Business and privately owned business were allowed under economic reforms.

###Demand of Independence
After these reforms,all over Europe(the satellite states or warsaw states), started to demand independence and change in communist government.

In 1989, Peaceful revolutions were made to get rid of communism in most countries except Romania where the leader,Nicolae Ceaușescu was shot dead by people.

Unlike in Hungary and Prague, this time there was no military suppression by Soviet Union to crush these revolutions.

Berlin wall fell and East and West Germany got united.

In response to Gorbachev's reforms, USA started talks for de escalation,limiting nuclear weapoins and removal of army from Afghanistan.

In Dec. 1991, USSR is dissolved due to internal revolution and all 15 sub national soviets form their soverign countries.

### Aftermath of Cold War

- Unipolar world- USA the only Superpower
- Russian Economy suffered badly
- Conflicts in Balkan states - Yugoslavia(1992 - 97(approx.))
- The threat of nuclear war is still there but very much less than during the span of cold war.
